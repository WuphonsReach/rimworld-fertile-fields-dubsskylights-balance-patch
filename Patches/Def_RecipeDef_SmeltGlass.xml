<!--
For the base Dubs Skylights, they are made out of pure steel.  

SmeltGlass: One GlassPane is made from four steel with a 1600 work amount.
SmeltGlass4x: Four GlassPane for 16 steel and 6400 work amount.

- Defs/RecipeDef[defName = "SmeltGlass"]
- Defs/RecipeDef[defName = "SmeltGlass4x"]

Fertile Fields patches this to:

SmeltGlass: One GlassPane is made from 2 steel plus 1 sand with a 1600 work amount.
SmeltGlass4x: (missing recipe))

The balance issue is that we've had to do a few steps to get sand from crushed stone.
And we're missing the SmeltGlass4x recipe.

- Reduce workAmount from (1600 to 500) and (6400 to 1800).
- Reduce steel amount for bulk recipe to 8 steel plus 4 sand.
